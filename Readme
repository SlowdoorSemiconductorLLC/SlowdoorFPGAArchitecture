The Slowdoor Semiconductor LLC Field Programmable Gate Array Block Source Code is
minified to save bytes.

The inout wires b, c, d and e are the four sides of the Slowdoor Semiconductor LLC Field
Programmable Gate Array Block. b is North, c is East, d is South, and e is West.

Register f can range in value from 3'b000 to 3'b101.
3'b000 = South side and West side output the bit from the output of the LUT2,
which has the North side as the [1:1] and the East side as the [0:0] addressing
the LUT2.
3'b001 = East side and West side output the bit from the output of the LUT2, which
has the North side as the [1:1] and the South side as the [0:0] addressing the
LUT2.
3'b010 = East side and South side output the bit from the output of the LUT2,
which has the North side as the [1:1] and the West side as the [0:0] addressing the LUT2.
3'b011 = North side and West side output the bit from the output of the LUT2,
which has the East side as the [1:1] and the South side as the [0:0] addressing the LUT2.
3'b100 = North side and South side output the bit from the output of the LUT2,
which has the East side as the [1:1] and the West side as the [0:0] addressing the LUT2.
3'b101 = North side and East side output the bit from the output of the LUT2,
which has the South side as the [1:1] and the West side as the [0:0] addressing the LUT2.
